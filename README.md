JavaScript Project --
# ColourFlipper
 
In this JavaScript project, we're going to create a colour flipper with random colour displays.
According to Leornardo Maldonado, he explains that --by manipulating the DOM, you have infinite possibilities. You can create applications that update the data of the page without needing a refresh. Also, you can create applications that are customizable by the user and then change the layout of the page without a refresh.-- [Colourchanger](https://carson3377.github.io/ColourChanger/colourflipper.html)

The JavaScript key methods may be applied:

- arrays
--> Create arrays to contain and list possible colours on both js files


- document.getElementById()
--> Select an Id from html file. I wanna select 'btn' to operate the clicking function when clicked on it changes random colours


- document.querySelector()
--> Select the 1st element '.color' matches CSS selector. Selecting this element to change the colour of the text


- addEventListener()
--> Add an event listener to apply an event 'click' and insert function to invoke the specified command or call


- document.body.style.backgroundColor
--> Change the entire body background colour to random colours when clicked on the button


- Math.floor()
--> Applies in the function to avoid long decimals in the console and specifies which position in the arrays to determine colours


- Math.random()
--> From 0-1 randomly picked, along with decimal places. This is to pick random colours.


- array.length
--> The length of the listed arrays containing different colours


- textContent
--> To return the specified text content like '#F1f5f8' from the class '.color'


- for loops (hex.js)
--> Need to loop 6 times for 6 random values for the hex colour value from the arrays


That's a Wrap!
